Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart, and the bar should be directly over your chest with your arms fully extended. Keep your feet flat on the floor, and your core engaged to stabilize your body.\r\nLower the Bar\r\nSlowly lower the EZ bar toward your forehead by bending your elbows, keeping your upper arms stationary. Keep your elbows pointed forward, and lower the bar until your forearms are parallel to the ground or slightly beyond, feeling a stretch in your triceps.\r\nPush the Bar Back Up\r\nPress the EZ bar back up by extending your elbows, fully contracting your triceps at the top of the movement. Be sure to keep control of the weight and avoid letting your elbows flare out. Repeat for your desired number of reps.\r\nTip\r\nTo avoid stress on your elbows or shoulders, keep your movements slow and controlled. Focus on using your triceps to lift the weight, and avoid arching your back.", MuscleGroupId = 11 }
